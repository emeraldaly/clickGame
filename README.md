# clickGame

I probably should have have been pushing during the entire process of working on this 
but I did a lot of this during my down time at work and I wasn't working with anyone else
so I will make a note of this in the future.  

* I am still trying to figure out how to only count the click of a unique picture once  
* In an ideal world, I would have a timer running so that the user knows how much time is left.
* I need to stop procrastinating so I can actually customize and have fun with these homeworks instead of
pushing it til the last minute.  That being said, I had fun with this one.  

# Alyson's revisions
* organized the js and css into folders.
* moved the inline css and js into the js and css files.
* changed the pictures from div's to buttons so they are clickable.
* followed example of others and added timer & disable images to avoid repeat clicks.
* added start/restart button.
* verified W3Validator
* ran Lint tests. Did not understand feedback "lint warning: increment (++) and decrement (--) operators used as part of greater statement"

# Criteria to check
* Syntax should be perfect! (HTML / JavaScript) (what is perfect?)
* W3 Validator should pass (yes)
* JavaScript should pass linting (yes except for -- as noted above)
* No inline styles (checked)
* No terrible variable / function names (In my opinion checked)
* Indentation should be better than anything you’ve ever seen (Verified)
* All alerts / prompts / confirms should be replaced with a modal (yes modal & inline HTML used)
* Fix functionality that isn’t working (Yes)
* Refactor JavaScript to be DRY (Need more info)
* Refactor any CSS to be more semantic and less code (limited CSS)
* No unnecessary markup (HTML), variables (JavaScript) (Not sure what this refers to)

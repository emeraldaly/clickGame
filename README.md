# clickGame

I probably should have have been pushing during the entire process of working on this 
but I did a lot of this during my down time at work and I wasn't working with anyone else
so I will make a note of this in the future.  

-I am still trying to figure out how to only count the click of a unique picture once  
-In an ideal world, I would have a timer running so that the user knows how much time is left.
-I need to stop procrastinating so I can actually customize and have fun with these homeworks instead of
pushing it til the last minute.  That being said, I had fun with this one.

-moved the inline css and js into the js and css files.
-changed the pictures from div's to buttons so they are clickable.
-followed example of others and added timer & disable images to avoid repeat clicks.
-added start/restart button.
